Javascript is astounding. A couple of lines of code in Java can be written in like two lines in Javascript. It's so multi-purpose that I might get lost trying to figure out how a certain part of the code works because it's so condensed. Compared to Java, Javascript seems like a more fun coding language. The only previous experience I had with Javascript was when I first started coding a Discord Bot. This was my first time ever coding, and the creation of this bot was so simple that my knowledge of Javascript didn't even scratch the surface compared to a day I spent on FreeCodeCamp learning Javascript. My only issue may be to adapt to the free-form nature of the coding language.

During one of Philip Johnson's screencast about Javascript, he mentioned that the free-form nature of it is both a blessing and a curse. For one, you can significantly reduce the amount of lines for a code. Just even doing the Javascript exercises on the FreeCodeCamp website taught me that multiple lines of a Java function can essentially be written on one line in Javascript. Variables are multipurpose, meaning you don't have to necessarily label them as strings or integers. I could initialize a variable called anything and literally put anything in that variable. It doesn't matter if it's a string or an integer, Javascript will detect it without me specifying what type of variable it is. The downside to this free-form nature of coding in Javascript is that, it's free-form. I'm so used to the strict nature of Java where I have to label everything exactly. I like to keep things tidy and know what a specific variable is capable of holding. If this variable holds only integers, I must label it as an integer. It'll take me a while to get used to Javascript and it's variables where anything can be put into them. Reading code might also be more difficult because I have to get used to seeing what variables hold what without the strict label on them.

It may seem fun to code in Javascript, but it'll take some to get used to coding effectively. The practice WODs found on the morea website do help with figuring out how to code for a certain task under a time constraint. It's stressful at first, but once you figured out the process it starts to become enjoyable. Seeing results like working out a WOD in record time helps raise my positivity.
