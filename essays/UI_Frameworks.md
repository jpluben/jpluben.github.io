UI Frameworks are not simple. In fact, they can be almost as complicated to learn as a new programming language. Given that, why bother to use something like Semantic UI? What does one get in return for the investment of time and frustration? Why not just use raw HTML and CSS? Are there software engineering benefits of UI frameworks?

create an engaging and informative essay about UI Frameworks. You might want to discuss some of the issues raised above, as well as your own personal experience with Semantic UI.

When I started learning about HTML and CSS, I just learned the basics. Creating a webpage with text and images seemed simple enough. Nothing looked weird or unordinarily out of place. If anything, creating a raw HTML and CSS just reminds me of old webpages that had just text all over it. Not necessarily nostalgic for me, but It just dawned on me that this is how webpages in its simplest form were created back in the day. Nowadays though, everything needs to look modern. It's unacceptable to leave webpages as just text on a screen. Navigation through the webpages also needs to be easy. Users will have to take one look at a webpage and know how to traverse it within a second. All of this could be done using raw HTML and CSS, but UI Frameworks help keeps things small and clean.


## UI Frameworks is not necessarily a necessity

I say that UI Frameworks is not a necessity, but that's mainly because everything can still be done using raw HTML and CSS. UI Frameworks just provides shortcuts for using those tools. I think that if you're a master at raw HTML and CSS, the most you'll get out of using a UI Framework is the reduction of code lines, after going through the frustration of having to learn it. That being said, if you're someone like me who's just starting to learn the basics of HTML and CSS, UI Frameworks are great stepping stones for learning. As previously stated, they help keep things looking clean and modern.
