#Project Information
For our final project in ICS 111, we were tasked with creating a game using Java. The knowledge of creating a game all came from the class. Our team of three decided on creating a simple top-down asteroid shooting game.

#My role in the project
Majority of the project was done and led by me. I was tasked with coding the movement for the ship, bullets, and asteroids, along with the hit detection for those objects, while the other two worked on coding the graphics and scoring portion of the project.

#What I have learned
This project was one of the firsts where I worked with a group for coding. I was able to interact with my teammates in real time since we were creating the code while next to each other. A good portion of the project has taught me how java works. This project has also taught me how to work with others to organize and properly get tasks done. I was very excited at how this game turned out considering it was one of the first major coding projects that I worked on
